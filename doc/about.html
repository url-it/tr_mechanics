<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>

Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output file(s),
they can be visualized in the appropriate output tabs. The "Max" count in each output tab will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by 
    Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>:

<h2><strong> Mechanics </strong> </h2>
<p>
Cell mechanics (cell movements in time) in Physicell are produced through interactions among cells (cell-cell interactions)and basement membrane (if present).  The impact of other cells and the BM (basement membrane) on the cell of interest isbest expressed through adhesion and repulsion.  The mechanics of adhesion and repulsion can be complicated, but they aremodeled by the equation below.Adhesionis a cell’s tendency to "stick" to things, whilerepulsionis a cell’s tendency tobe pushed away.  The range and combination of these forces ultimately creates a sweet spot for a cell at a certain distanceaway from its neighbors where it tends to rest, similar to the Leonard-Jones potential in atomic and particle Physics.The main equation in mechanics that we will be referencing is:</p>

<p>
Where vi and xi are  the  velocity  and  position  of  the  cell  in  question. xj is  the  position  of  another  cell  in  the  first  cellsneighborhood (this is what is meant by j is N(i)). Ccca represents the cell to cell adhesion (Cca) coefficient on theithcell.  This is NOT raised to power i or j.  The other C constants are represented similarly and described in the Members/Parameters section.  When the summation for all the cell components is said and done, then repulsion and adhesion are considered withthe basement matrix, and finally these correctional terms to the cell's velocity are added to its original velocity.
</p>

<p>
The functions &phi; and &psi; are the adhesion and repulsion interaction functions (respectively), which is dependent upon the cellsand outside the scope of this lesson.  The subscripts to those functionsRi, etc.  are therelative maximum adhesion distance,a parameter mentioned later in this lesson. d(xi) is the distance from the Basement membrane to the cell in question, and n(xj) is the unit vector normal to the basement membrane.

<h3> Cell to Cell repulsion </h3>
<p>
&quot;cell_cell_repulsion_strength&quot; is the parameterCccrin the default PhysiCell mechanics model.  It regulates the relative strengthof cell-cell "repulsive" forces (resistance to deformation and compression)..

<p>Modify the parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot; and &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the behavior of the cells , click the &quot;Cell Plots&quot; tab, and slide the bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;Max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>To view the changing substrate fields, click the &quot;Substrate Plots&quot; tab, choose a substrate from the drop-down menu, 
and slide through the saved times. Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, 
so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
