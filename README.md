This repo is a prototype for using Google Colab for running the PhysiCell Training Apps (in lieu of nanoHUB).

* download this notebook to your computer: https://github.com/rheiland/tr_mechanics/blob/master/examples/physicell_tr_mechanics-no-hublib.ipynb
* In Colab, `File` menu: `New notebook in Drive`, then `Upload notebook` (select the one above that you just downloaded), then `Runtime` menu: `Run all`
* if successful, it will display the app's GUI after the final notebook cell's
